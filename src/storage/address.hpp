/**
 * A data structure that tracks a Vertex/Edge location (address) that's either
 * local or remote. The remote address is a global id alongside the id of the
 * worker on which it's currently stored, while the local address is simply the
 * memory address in the current local process. Both types of address are stored
 * in the same storage space, so an Address always takes as much memory as a
 * pointer does.
 *
 * The memory layout for storage is on x64 architecture is the following:
 *  - the lowest bit stores 0 if address is local and 1 if address is global
 *  - if the address is local all 64 bits store the local memory address
 *  - if the address is global then lowest bit stores 1. the following
 *    kWorkerIdSize bits contain the worker id and the final (upper) 64 - 1 -
 *    kWorkerIdSize bits contain the global id.
 *
 * @tparam TRecord - Type of record this address points to. Either Vertex or
 * Edge.
