;;; Cap'n Proto schema and C++ serialization code generation

;;; Schema generation
;;;
;;; The basic algorthm should work as follows.
;;;   1) C++ class (or struct) is converted to the same named Capnp struct.
;;;   2) C++ class members are converted to camelCased members of Capnp struct.
;;;      a) Primitive C++ types are mapped to primitive Capnp types.
;;;      b) C++ std types are converted to our Capnp wrappers found in
;;;         utils/serialization.capnp. This process is hardcoded.
;;;      c) For other composite types, we assume that a Capnp struct exists
;;;         with the same PascalCase name as the *top-most* base class.
;;;      d) The user may provide a :CAPNP-TYPE string, which overrides our
;;;         decision making. Alternatively, a user may register the conversion
;;;         with `CAPNP-TYPE-CONVERSION'.
;;;   3) Handle C++ inheritance by checking direct subclasses of C++ class.
;;;      * Inheritance can be modeled with a union or composition.
;;;
;;;        Since with Capnp we cannot use the pointer casting trick from C
;;;        when modeling inheritance with composition, we are only left with
;;;        union. This is an ok solution for single inheritance trees, but C++
;;;        allows for multiple inheritance. This poses a problem.
;;;
;;;        Luckily, most of our use cases of multiple inheritance are only for
;;;        mixin classes to reuse some functionality. This allows us to model
;;;        multiple inheritance via composition. These classes need to be
;;;        marked as such for Capnp. Obviously, this precludes serialization
;;;        of pointers to mixin classes, but we should deal with that in C++
;;;        code on a case by case basis.
;;;
;;;        The algorithm is then the following.
;;;      a) If C++ class is the only parent of the direct sublcass, add the
;;;         direct subclass to union.
;;;      b) If C++ class isn't the only parent (multiple inheritance), then
;;;         check whether our class marked to be composed in the derived. If
;;;         yes, don't generate the union for direct subclass. Otherwise,
;;;         behave as 3.a)
;;;   4) Handle C++ template parameters of a class
;;;      Currently we require that explicit instantiations be listed in
;;;      TYPE-ARGS of `CAPNP-OPTS'. These arguments are then used to generate
;;;      a union, similarly to how inheritance is handled. This approach does
;;;      not support inheriting from template classes.

;;; Capnp C++ serialization code generation
;;;
;;; Algorithm is closely tied with the generated schema (see above).
;;;
;;; 1) Generate the method declaration.
;;;
;;; Two problems arise:
;;;  * inheritance and
;;;  * helper arguments (for tracking pointers or similar).
;;;
;;; The method will always take a pointer to a capnp::<T>::Builder
;;; class. Additional arguments are optional, and are supplied when declaring
;;; that the class should be serialized with capnp.
;;;
;;; To determine the concrete T we need to know whether this class is a
;;; derived one or is inherited from. If it is, then T needs to be the
;;; top-most parent that is modeled by union and not composition. (For the
;;; inheritance modeling problem, refer to the description of schema
;;; generation.) Obviously, the method now needs to be virtual. If this class
;;; has no inheritance in any direction, then we just use the class name for
;;; T prepended with capnp:: namespace.
;;;
;;; Helper arguments are obtained from SAVE-ARGS of `CAPNP-OPTS'.
;;;
;;; 2) Generate parent calls for serialization (if we have parent classes).
;;;
;;; For the first (and only) parent which is modeled through union, generate a
;;; <Parent>::Save call. The call is passed all of the arguments from out
;;; function declaration.
;;;
;;; Find our own concrete builder by traversing through the union schema of
;;; the base builder. It is expected (and required) that the parent call has
;;; initialized them correctly. We just need to initialize the most concrete
;;; builder.
;;;
;;; Other parents are required to be modelled through composition. Therefore,
;;; we generate calls to parents by passing builders for the composed structs.
;;;     auto parent_builder = builder->initParent();
;;;     Parent::Save(&parent_builder);
;;; Any additional helper arguments are also passed to the above call.
;;;
;;; 3) Generate member serialization.
;;;
;;; For primitive typed member, generate builder->setMember(member_); calls.
;;;
;;; For std types, generate hardcoded calls to our wrapper functions. Most of
;;; these require a lambda function which serializes the element inside the
;;; std class. This can be done recursively with this step.
;;;
;;; For composite types, check whether we have been given a custom save
;;; invocation. If not, assume that the type has a member function called Save
;;; which expects a builder for that type and any additional helper arguments.

Class name may be a list where the first element is the class name, while
others are template arguments.

For example:

;; (define-class (optional t-value)
;;    ...)

defines a templated C++ class:

template <class TValue>
class Optional { ... };

Each C++ member/slot definition is of the form:
;; (name cpp-type slot-options)

slot-options are keyword arguments. Currently supported options are:
  * :initval -- initializer value for the member, a C++ string or a number.
  * :reader -- if t, generates a public getter for the member.
  * :scope -- class scope of the member, either :public, :protected or :private (default).
  * :documentation -- Doxygen documentation of the member.
  * :save-fun -- Custom code for serializing this member.
  * :load-fun -- Custom code for deserializing this member.

Currently supported class-options are:
  * :documentation -- Doxygen documentation of the class.
  * :public -- additional C++ code in public scope.
  * :protected -- additional C++ code in protected scope.
  * :private -- additional C++ code in private scope.
  * :serialize -- only :boost and :capnp are valid values.  Setting :boost
    will generate boost serialization code for the class members.  Setting
    :capnp will generate the Cap'n Proto serialization code for the class
    members.  You may specifiy additional options after :capnp to fill the
    `CAPNP-OPTS' slots.

Larger example:

;; (lcp:define-class derived (base)
;;   ((val :int :reader t :initval 42))
;;   (:public #>cpp void set_val(int new_val) { val_ = new_val; } cpp<#)
;;   (:serialize :boost))

Generates C++:

;; class Derived : public Base {
;;  public:
;;   void set_val(int new_val) { val_ = new_val; }
;;   auto val() { return val_; } // autogenerated from :reader t
;;
;;  private:
;;   friend class boost::serialization::access;
;;   template <class TArchive>
;;   void serialize(TArchive &ar, unsigned int) {
;;     ar & boost::serialization::base_object<Base>(*this);
;;     ar & val_;
;;   }
